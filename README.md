# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Below is an analysis of kickstarter data that will help you see which types of campaigns have been successful depending on category, time of the year, country, and fundraising goal.


First, let's look at the chart below which shows all kickstarter campaigns and their number of successes, failures, cancelations, and those that are live. (Please note that this graph is only of the kickstarters in the US.)

# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Below is an analysis of kickstarter data that will help you see which types of campaigns have been successful depending on category, time of the year, country, and fundraising goal.


First, let's look at the chart below which shows all kickstarter campaigns and their number of successes, failures, cancelations, and those that are live. (Please note that this graph is only of the kickstarters in the US.)

Within the category of theater, this graph shows 26 canceled, 349 failed, 12 live, and 525 successful campaigns.
This tells us that about 58% of theater kickstarters were successful while 38% failed. 


Within the theater category exist 3 subcategories: musical, plays, and spaces.
Let's look specifically at plays.

250 failed, 9 live, and 412 successful. So, 37% failed but 61% succeeded! These numbers look more in your favor!


Launch dates can also affect how well a campaign does.
Let's look at US-based theater projects.

There is definitely a pattern emerging here. It looks like summer projects (and probably Valentine's projects) tend to have success.
This means you should prepare your campaign for sometime around May, June, or July.


The last part of the data that we will briefly view here is different from the rest because we are now looking away from America and heading to Great Britain to see the success of musicals there!

This Box Plot shows us that the average goal amount for a musical in Britain is about 4,000 euros.
Because of the analysis done on the "Descriptive Statistics" tab of the Excel form, we know that US, theater/play kickstarters with higher goals tend to fail and get significantly lower pledge amounts. 
This information combined with the above graph for musicals in Britain leads me to recommend that if Louise's next move is to campaign for a musical in Britain, she should keep the goal less than 4,000 pounds.
